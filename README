The purpose of this is to add enableDrawing, enableEditing, and disableEditing to a GMap API v3
	Polyline and Polygon.  Right now it is only applied to a Polyline.  To use this,
	instead of doing "new google.maps.Polyline", do "new google.mapsextensions.Polyline" with the
	same interface.  The new polyline has enableDrawing, enableEditing, and disableEditing with the
	same options as v2 of the API.

This release makes use of the Latitude/longitude spherical geodesy formulae & scripts written by
